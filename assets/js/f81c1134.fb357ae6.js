Along with various cleanup improvements, you can now register your own agents as a user and replay pipelines directly from the server using cli exec.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nTo enhance the usability of Woodpecker and comply with evolving security standards, we periodically implement migrations. While we strive to minimize changes, some adjustments are essential for an improved user experience.\\nWe acknowledge that this release includes a significant number of changes, many of which require users to update their pipeline definitions. We understand that this can be a tedious task, especially when managing multiple repositories and pipelines.\\nRest assured that each modification was carefully considered and thoroughly discussed, with specific reasoning behind every decision.\\n\\nA substantial portion of these updates aims to transition away from outdated and suboptimal Drone definitions. Your patience and understanding as we implement these necessary changes are greatly appreciated. If you encounter any major issues during your migration to a new version, please don\'t hesitate to reach out. The Woodpecker maintainers are always eager to reassess and improve our updates based on your feedback.\\n\\nSecurity has been a primary focus in this major release. In addition to patching known vulnerabilities (which have also been backported to v2 releases), we have enhanced the secrets handling mechanism to prevent accidental leaks and simplify the process of keeping sensitive information fully encrypted.\\n\\nFor a complete list of migration steps, please refer to the [migration guide](/migrations).\\n\\n### `from_secret:` as the powerful replacement for the `secrets:` keyword\\n\\nSpecifically, the `secrets:` keyword has been deprecated in favor of a more flexible (and secure) way to specify secrets: `from_secret:`.\\nThis new approach provides more flexibility (by using different names for the source and destination secrets) and ensures a safe internal secret parsing through a unified engine.\\nBecause secrets defined via `secrets:` were simple env vars in the end, this change also removes potential confusion about the differences between values specified in `environment:` and `secrets`.\\nNow, both are defined in `environment:` using an expressive syntax:\\n\\n```yaml\\nsteps:\\n  name:\\n    image: alpine\\n    commands:\\n      - echo \\"The secret is $TOKEN_ENV\\"\\n    environment:\\n      TOKEN_ENV:\\n        from_secret: SECRET_TOKEN\\n```\\n\\n## Register Your Own Agents for Users or Organizations [#3539](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3539)\\n\\nWoodpeckerCI now lets you register custom agents scoped to individual users or organizations. This means you can bring your own agents, configured to meet the unique needs of your projects, and assign them to specific users or organizational workflows.\\n\\nThis update provides flexibility for teams with diverse requirements, allowing them to integrate agents tailored to specific tasks or environments seamlessly into their pipelines.\\n\\n## Replay Pipelines Locally Using `cli exec` [#4103](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/4103)\\n\\nDebugging pipelines no longer requires endless small adjustments and repeated pushes. With the new `woodpecker-cli exec` feature, you can download pipeline metadata directly from the server and replay it locally. This allows you to test and fix issues in a similar environment to the server, all from your machine.\\n\\n![debug-pipelines-option](debug-pipelines.png)\\n\\nBy locally debugging, this feature accelerates the development process and provides deeper insights into pipeline behavior without relying on server-side execution for every small change.\\n\\n:::info\\nIn order to use this feature, all required pipeline elements must be passed, e.g. secrets.\\nHowever, secrets are not included in the pipeline metadata and must be passed manually to the local execution call.\\n:::\\n\\n## Rootless images\\n\\nWoodpecker now supports running rootless images by adjusting the entrypoints and directory permissions in the containers in a way that allows non-privileged users to execute tasks.\\n\\nIn addition, all images published by Woodpecker (Server, Agent, CLI) now use a non-privileged user (`woodpecker` with UID and GID `1000`) by default. If you have volumes attached to the containers, you may need to change the ownership of these directories from `root` to `woodpecker` by executing `chown -R 1000:1000 <mount dir>`.\\n\\n:::info\\nThe agent image must remain rootful by default to be able to mount the Docker socket when Woodpecker is used with the `docker` backend.\\nThe helm chart will start to use a non-privileged user by utilizing `securityContext`.\\nRunning a completely rootless agent with the `docker` backend may be possible by using a rootless docker daemon.\\nHowever, this requires more work and is currently not supported.\\n:::\\n\\n## Fine grained control over approvals options\\n\\nWoodpecker 3.0.0 introduces enhanced approval options. Beyond requiring approval for all pipeline events, you can now configure it specifically for all pull requests or only for pull requests originating from forks.\\n\\nBy default, public repositories will now mandate approval for pull requests from forks. This helps prevent potentially malicious PRs from exposing secrets or performing unauthorized actions without the repository owner\'s awareness.\\n\\n![screenshot of new approval-requirements options](approval-requirements.png)\\n\\n## UI\\n\\nWe have fixed many UI-related bugs in this version.\\nMany were small misalignment related to padding, margins or other edge cases related to small screen sizes.\\nWe also aimed to harmonize the icons across the UI, specifically across logical subgroups, such as status-icons or admin panel icons.\\n\\nUI elements are now sized in a relative way, meaning they will all scale relative when you change the font-size or zoom in/out.\\n\\n## Deleting old pipeline logs\\n\\nDeleting a pipeline now successfully also deletes its related logs.\\nBeforehand, there was an issue where the logs were not deleted and were kept in the DB forever.\\n\\nYou might want to check [#4572](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/4572) for more details including a snippet how to delete orphaned entries of a Postgres DB.\\n\\n:::info\\nThere is no option yet to auto-delete old pipeline logs after a specific time or event.\\nPlease follow [#1068](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/issues/1068) for future updates.\\n:::\\n\\n## Migration to standard Linux CRON syntax\\n\\nCRON definitions now follow standard Linux syntax without seconds. An automatic migration will attempt to update your settings - ensure the update completes successfully.\\n\\n## Known Issues\\n\\nThe generic `pipeline definition not found` is still present and not yet understood.\\nThis error message can be triggered by various elements (which the most likely one being a (temporary) connection issue with the forge) and the error return/output must be improved first in order to take appropriate action."},{"id":"release-v250","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-v250","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-27-release-v2.5.0/index.md","title":"Here is Woodpecker 2.5.0","description":"Introducing Woodpecker 2.5.0","date":"2024-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"minor","permalink":"/blog/tags/minor"}],"readingTime":2.7,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Anbraten","title":"Maintainer of Woodpecker","url":"https://github.com/anbraten","image_url":"https://github.com/anbraten.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/anbraten.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Here is Woodpecker 2.5.0","description":"Introducing Woodpecker 2.5.0","slug":"release-v250","authors":[{"name":"Anbraten","title":"Maintainer of Woodpecker","url":"https://github.com/anbraten","image_url":"https://github.com/anbraten.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/anbraten.png"}],"tags":["release","minor"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Woodpecker 3.0.0","permalink":"/blog/release-v300"},"nextItem":{"title":"[Community] Continuous Deployment","permalink":"/blog/continuous-deployment"}},"content":"Here is the next minor release 2.5.0 of Woodpecker \u{1FAB6} \u2600\uFE0F.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAs always thanks to all contributors who helped to make this release possible. It includes quite a few enhancements\\nmost users will benefit from while they are probably not that visible at first sight for most. The release also includes some preparations for new features to come in the next versions. Anyway, let\'s dive into some of the highlights of this release:\\n\\n## Improve the way entrypoints work\\n\\nThe implementation wasn\'t perfect yet so we improved the way entrypoints work:\\n\\nIf you define [`commands`](/docs/usage/workflow-syntax#commands), the default entrypoint will be `[\\"/bin/sh\\", \\"-c\\", \\"echo $CI_SCRIPT | base64 -d | /bin/sh -e\\"]`.\\n\\nIf you define your own entrypoint, you can completely overwrite the default entrypoint. If you define `entrypoint: [\\"/bin/my-script\\", \\"\\"]` for example you can run your own binary / script. In this case the commands section will ignored, however you can still access it in your own script by using the base64 encoded string of the `CI_SCRIPT` environment variable.\\n\\n[#3269](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3269)\\n\\n## Cli output formats\\n\\nThe cli output has been improved. The first command (mainly pipeline info, ls, create) support a `--output` flag now which allows you to change the output format. There is a new `table` format (the new default) which will look like the following and can be further customized:\\n\\n```bash\\n# use default table output\\n\u276F woodpecker-cli pipeline ls --limit 2 2\\nNUMBER  STATUS   EVENT   BRANCH  COMMIT                                    AUTHOR\\n43      error    manual  main    473761d8b26b20f7c206408563d54cf998410329  woodpecker\\n42      success  push    main    473761d8b26b20f7c206408563d54cf998410329  woodpecker\\n\\n# customize table output and disable header\\n\u276F woodpecker-cli pipeline ls --limit 2 --output table=number,status,event --no-header 2\\n43  error    manual\\n42  success  push\\n```\\n\\nIn addition especially useful for programmatic usage there is a `go-template` output format which will output the data using the provided go template like this:\\n\\n```bash\\n########\\n# go crazy and use a template layout\\n\u276F woodpecker-cli pipeline ls --limit 2 --output go-template=\'{{range .}}{{printf \\"\\\\x1b[33mPipeline #%d\\\\x1b[0m\\\\nStatus: %s\\\\nEvent:%s\\\\nCommit:%s\\\\n\\\\n\\" .Number .Status .Event .Commit}}{{end}}\' 2\\nPipeline #43\\nStatus: error\\nEvent:manual\\nCommit:473761d8b26b20f7c206408563d54cf998410329\\n\\nPipeline #42\\nStatus: success\\nEvent:push\\nCommit:473761d8b26b20f7c206408563d54cf998410329\\n```\\n\\n[#3660](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3660)\\n\\n## Deleting logs or complete pipelines\\n\\nIf you accidentally exposed some secret to the public in your logs or you simply want to cleanup some logs you can now delete logs or complete pipelines using the api and the cli.\\n\\n[#3451](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3451)\\n[#3506](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3506)\\n[#3458](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3458)\\n\\n## Support for Github deploy tasks\\n\\nWoodpecker now supports Github deploy tasks. This allows you to pass the deploy task set in Github to your Woodpecker pipeline.\\n\\n[#3512](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3512)\\n\\n## Deprecations\\n\\nTo keep things clean and simple we deprecated some pipeline options, server settings and features which will\\nbe removed in the next major release:\\n\\n- Deprecated `environment` filter, use `when.evaluate`\\n- Use `WOODPECKER_EXPERT_FORGE_OAUTH_HOST` instead of `WOODPECKER_DEV_GITEA_OAUTH_URL` or `WOODPECKER_DEV_OAUTH_HOST`\\n- Deprecated `WOODPECKER_WEBHOOK_HOST` in favor of `WOODPECKER_EXPERT_WEBHOOK_HOST`\\n\\nFor a full list of deprecations that will be dropped in the `next` major release `3.0.0` (no eta yet), please check the [migrations](/migrations#next) section."},{"id":"continuous-deployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/continuous-deployment","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-01-continuous-deployment/index.md","title":"[Community] Continuous Deployment","description":"Deploy your artifacts to an app server","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"cd","permalink":"/blog/tags/cd"},{"inline":true,"label":"deployment","permalink":"/blog/tags/deployment"}],"readingTime":1.97,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"lonix1","url":"https://github.com/lonix1","image_url":"https://github.com/lonix1.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/lonix1.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[Community] Continuous Deployment","description":"Deploy your artifacts to an app server","slug":"continuous-deployment","authors":[{"name":"lonix1","url":"https://github.com/lonix1","image_url":"https://github.com/lonix1.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/lonix1.png"}],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"tags":["community","cd","deployment"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Here is Woodpecker 2.5.0","permalink":"/blog/release-v250"},"nextItem":{"title":"[Community] Podman image build with sigstore","permalink":"/blog/podman-image-build-sigstore"}},"content":"A typical CI pipeline contains steps such as: _clone_, _build_, _test_, _package_ and _push_. The final build product may be artifacts pushed to a git repository or a docker container pushed to a container registry.\\n\\nWhen these should be deployed on an app server, the pipeline should include a _deploy_ step, which represents the \\"CD\\" in CI/CD - the automatic deployment of a pipeline\'s final product.\\n\\nThere are various ways to accomplish CD with Woodpecker, depending on your project\'s specific needs.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Invoking deploy script via SSH\\n\\nThe final step in your pipeline could SSH into the app server and run a deployment script.\\n\\nOne of the benefits would be that the deployment script\'s output could be included in the pipeline\'s log. However in general, this is a complicated option as it tightly couples the CI and app servers.\\n\\nAn SSH step could be written by using a plugin, like [ssh](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/ssh) or [git push](https://woodpecker-ci.org/plugins/git-push).\\n\\n## Polling for asset changes\\n\\nThis option completely decouples the CI and app servers, and there is no explicit deploy step in the pipeline.\\n\\nOn the app server, one should create a script or cron job that polls for asset changes (every minute, say). When a new version is detected, the script redeploys the app.\\n\\nThis option is easy to maintain, but the downside is a short delay (one minute) before new assets are detected.\\n\\n## Using a configuration management tool\\n\\nIf you are using a configuration management tool (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet), then you could setup the last pipeline step to call that tool to perform the redeployment.\\n\\nA plugin for [Ansible](https://woodpecker-ci.org/plugins/ansible) exists and could be adapted accordingly.\\n\\nThis option is complex and only suitable in an environment in which you\'re already using configuration management.\\n\\n## Using webhooks (recommended)\\n\\nIf your forge (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, etc.) supports webhooks, then you could create a separate listening app that receives a webhook when new assets are available and redeploys your app.\\n\\nThe listening \\"app\\" can be something as simple as a PHP script.\\n\\nAlternatively, there are a number of popular webhook servers that simplify this process, so you only need to write your actual deployment script. For example, [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook) and [webhookd](https://github.com/ncarlier/webhookd).\\n\\nThis is arguably the simplest and most maintainable solution."},{"id":"podman-image-build-sigstore","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-image-build-sigstore","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-15-podman-sigstore/index.md","title":"[Community] Podman image build with sigstore","description":"Build images in Podman with sigstore signature checking and signing","date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"image","permalink":"/blog/tags/image"},{"inline":true,"label":"podman","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman"},{"inline":true,"label":"sigstore","permalink":"/blog/tags/sigstore"},{"inline":true,"label":"signature","permalink":"/blog/tags/signature"}],"readingTime":2.42,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"handlebargh","url":"https://github.com/handlebargh","image_url":"https://github.com/handlebargh.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/handlebargh.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[Community] Podman image build with sigstore","description":"Build images in Podman with sigstore signature checking and signing","slug":"podman-image-build-sigstore","authors":[{"name":"handlebargh","url":"https://github.com/handlebargh","image_url":"https://github.com/handlebargh.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/handlebargh.png"}],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"tags":["community","image","podman","sigstore","signature"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[Community] Continuous Deployment","permalink":"/blog/continuous-deployment"},"nextItem":{"title":"[Community] Debug pipeline steps","permalink":"/blog/debug-pipeline-steps"}},"content":"\x3c!-- cspell:ignore BQVUJ Containerfile cosing distroless fulcio keypair nonroot QVRFLS rekor skopeo --\x3e\\n\\nThis example shows how to build a container image with podman while verifying the base image and signing the resulting image.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe image being pulled uses a keyless signature, while the image being built will be signed by a pre-generated private key.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n### Generate signing keypair\\n\\nYou can use cosing or skopeo to generate the keypair.\\n\\nUsing skopeo:\\n\\n```bash\\nskopeo generate-sigstore-key --output-prefix myKey\\n```\\n\\nThis command will generate a `myKey.private` and a `myKey.pub` keyfile.\\n\\nStore the `myKey.private` as secret in Woodpecker.

Therefore, be sure to run trusted code only in this setup.\\n\\nThis seems to work fine so far.

This release includes a lot of new features, improvements and some breaking changes which most of you probably already tested using the `next` tag or the RC version.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How we plan to handle releases in the future\\n\\nIn the future, there won\'t be backports anymore as they require quite an amount of maintenance. Instead, we\'ll release our current state of the `main` branch with the correct version (according to semver) every few weeks. Of course, critical bug and security fixes are released as soon as possible. To not release new major version too often, we\'ll try to hold back breaking changes pull-request for a longer time and release them all together in a new major version.\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\n### Renamed some api routes\\n\\nWe renamed some API routes to be more consistent. So we suggest admins to update all repository webhooks by clicking on the newly added `Repair all repositories` button in the admin settings.\\n\\n### Dropped deprecated environment variables and CLI commands\\n\\nFor v1.0.0, we deprecated a bunch of old environment variables like `CI_BUILD_*`. These variables were removed in this version, you therefore have to use the new ones.\\nAlso, the deprecated `build` command of the CLI was removed. Use `pipeline` instead.\\n\\n### Removed SSH backend\\n\\nDue to various issues with the SSH backend we decided to remove it.\\nAs an alternative, you can install an agent running the local backend directly on the remote machine or you can simply execute `ssh` commands connecting to the remote server in your pipeline.\\n\\n### Deprecated `platform` filter\\n\\nThe `platform` filter has been removed. Use the more advanced labels instead ([read more](../docs/usage/workflow-syntax#filter-by-platform)).\\n\\n### Update Docker to v24\\n\\nWe updated Docker to v24 as of some security patches. If you use an older version of Docker, you might need to upgrade it.\\n\\n### Removed plugin-only option from secrets\\n\\nSecurity is pretty important to us and we want to make sure that no one can steal your secrets. Therefore, we decided to remove the plugin-only option from secrets and instead, if you define an image filter, it will be automatically only available to plugins using the defined image names.\\n\\n## Migration notes\\n\\nThere have been a few more breaking changes. [Read more about what you need to do when upgrading!](/migrations#200)\\n\\n## New features\\n\\nBut that\'s enough about breaking changes. Let\'s talk about the new features!\\n\\n### Config warnings and errors in the UI\\n\\nYou ever wondered why a secret was not working and after hours of debugging you found out that you misspelled the secret name? Or you used a wrong key in your YAML config? Woodpecker now shows errors and linter warnings directly in it\'s UI, notifying you about missing secrets, incorrect configuration or deprecated settings!\\n\\n![Image of warnings and errors in the UI](./linter_warnings_errors.png)\\n\\n### Repository and organization overview for admins\\n\\nAdmins now get an overview over all repositories and organizations registered on the server, allowing them to perform common actions like deleting directly from the admin dashboard.\\n\\n![Image of repos overview](./admin_repos.png)\\n\\n### Support for user secrets\\n\\nIt is now possible to add secrets for all repos owned by yourself, similar to organization and global secrets.\\n\\n### Bitbucket cloud support for multi-workflows\\n\\nWe enhanced support for Bitbucket, allowing you to use multiple workflows just as you probably know from all other forges already.\\n\\n### Full support for Kubernetes backend\\n\\nMany of you already used it extensively in the past, but now we can finally call the Kubernetes backend ready for production use. Supporting all major features and even quite some Kubernetes specific options.\\n\\n### Auto theme\\n\\nThe UI now supports automatically adapting the theme to your browser config, so no more light mode in the middle of the night!\\n\\n### Update notification\\n\\nUpdates are awesome as they bring new features and bug fixes most of the time, but sometimes there are also important security fixes which should be installed as soon as possible. To not miss any of them, we added a notification to the UI for admins if there\'s a new update available.\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\nThe full changelog can be viewed in our project source folder at [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)"},{"id":"release-v100","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-v100","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-28-release-v1.0.0/index.md","title":"Presenting Woodpecker 1.0.0","description":"Introducing Woodpecker 1.0.0 and its new features.","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"major","permalink":"/blog/tags/major"}],"readingTime":1.65,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"6543","title":"Maintainer of Woodpecker","url":"https://github.com/6543","image_url":"https://github.com/6543.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/6543.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Presenting Woodpecker 1.0.0","description":"Introducing Woodpecker 1.0.0 and its new features.","slug":"release-v100","authors":[{"name":"6543","title":"Maintainer of Woodpecker","url":"https://github.com/6543","image_url":"https://github.com/6543.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/6543.png"}],"tags":["release","major"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"It\'s time for some changes -
